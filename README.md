## Design Philosophy

The design emphasizes a dark mode aesthetic with neural-inspired colors (electric blue, teal, crimson) to create an immersive and futuristic experience. Key principles include:

- **Neuromorphic Interface**: UI elements that mimic neural structures and connections
- **Fluid Transitions**: Smooth animations between sections that feel organic
- **Adaptive Design**: Layout and interactions that adjust naturally to different screen sizes
- **Accessible Contrast**: Ensuring readability while maintaining visual distinctiveness
- **Technological Elegance**: Clean, minimalist design that highlights content while showcasing technical sophistication

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel (recommended for Next.js projects) but can also be deployed to:

- **Netlify**: Compatible with automatic deployments from git
- **GitHub Pages**: With proper export settings
- **Custom Hosting**: Can be built and served from any Node.js environment

Deployment instructions:
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# For Vercel
vercel

# For Netlify
netlify deploy
```
